# Quantum Field Theory Notes and Resources

ðŸ“˜ A personal repository for studying **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**.  
This project documents my journey through key concepts in QFT using LaTeX notes, Python/Mathematica simulations, and problem-solving scripts.

## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This repository is designed to:

- Organize and track my progress in studying Quantum Field Theory.
- Share clean and structured notes, problem solutions, and code.
- Provide helpful resources for others studying QFT, especially physics undergraduates and early graduate students.

The material here is based on standard QFT textbooks such as:

- _MIT OCW - Realtivistic Quantum Field Theory 1,2,3_ ([8.323](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-323-relativistic-quantum-field-theory-i-spring-2023/) , [8.324](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-324-relativistic-quantum-field-theory-ii-fall-2010/), [8.325](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-325-relativistic-quantum-field-theory-iii-spring-2003/))
- _Peskin & Schroeder â€“ An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_
- _Schwartz â€“ Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model_
- _Weinberg â€“ The Quantum Theory of Fields_
